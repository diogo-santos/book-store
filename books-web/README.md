## Getting the code on your computer
- [ ] Download and install <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/download/" target="_blank">Node.js</a>
- [ ] Download the project or clone it from https://github.com/bryanosullivan/mastercard-fullstack-coding-challenge-20200828-DS

```
cd books-web
npm install
npm start
```

#### What I have developed in the allotted time
- [ ] Fetch all books
- [ ] Pagination component
- [ ] Delete Book
- [ ] View Book
- [ ] Sort dropdown
- [ ] Items per page dropdown
- [ ] Testing components with react test library

#### Include any important design decisions you made along the way.
- [ ] Leveraging React pagination component
- [ ] Creating a generic components for DropDown and Modal
- [ ] It does not call getBookById endpoint as the book info was fetched and stored into state

#### Given more time, what would you have done differently?
- [ ] Add more tests
- [ ] Add api token for security
- [ ] Internationalization using i18
- [ ] Caching fetched results
